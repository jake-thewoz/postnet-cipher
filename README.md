#Postnet-Cipher

This is a set of tools for translating the (legacy) USPS method of encoding zipcodes on mail, called Postnet. Postnet works by encoding zipcodes into a scannable form of binary to be printed on mail.

This program uses C++, and allows the user to translate between numerical zipcodes and the Postnet version of the zipcode, implemented through the use of a Cipher object.
